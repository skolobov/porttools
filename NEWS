0.20 (27.07.2003)
- change: the only supported method of installation is through devel/porttools
  port from now on; Makefile is no longer included with the distribution
- new: added manpages
- change: testport was converted to use getopt(1)
- new: pr-update now accepts command-line arguments using getopt(1):
  -m mode, -s severity, -p priority
- new: scripts now contain (and sometime display) the tools version number
- bugfix: testport: do not check for extra files if $PREFIX does not exist

0.16 (21.07.2003)
- bugfix: do not remove PKG_DBDIR in "clean before build phase:
          it cause failure when in install phase with new code
	  in bsd.port.mk
- cosmetique: change prefix in testport's output

0.15 (14.07.2003)
- respect PKGNAMEPREFIX and PKGNAMESUFFIX in pr-* scripts (thanks, Tim!)
- minor fixes/cleanups
- added THANKS file to list contributors

0.11 (08.07.2003)
- detect situations where maintainership change is requested, adjust
  PR form respectively
- fix bug which prevented submitted patch to be saved in ${ARCHIVE_DIR}

0.10 (25.06.2003)
- add configuration file (~/.porttools), generated automatically if it does not exist
- pr-update, pr-change, pr-new are symlinks to a single script, mode detected based on $0
- do not use send-pr.template anymore - instead, PR form is generated from by the script
- cleanup after aborted send-pr(1) - delete generated files and /tmp/pbad.*
- testport uses configuration file, too
- testport: BUILDROOT can override where PREFIX is located (default: in /tmp)
- testport: allow running several testport processes - use PREFIX=${BUILDROOT}/${PKGNAME}
  (instead of /tmp/${PORTNAME}) and mktemp(1)-ed PKG_DBDIR
