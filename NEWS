  PR form respectively

- add configuration file (~/.porttools), generated automatically if it does not exist
- pr-update, pr-change, pr-new are symlinks to a single script, mode detected based on $0
- do not use send-pr.template anymore - instead, PR form is generated from by the script
- cleanup after aborted send-pr(1) - delete generated files and /tmp/pbad.*
- testport uses configuration file, too
- testport: BUILDROOT can override where PREFIX is located (default: in /tmp)
- testport: allow running several testport processes - use PREFIX=${BUILDROOT}/${PKGNAME}
  (instead of /tmp/${PORTNAME}) and mktemp(1)-ed PKG_DBDIR
