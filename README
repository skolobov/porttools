FreeBSD Port Tools

Copyright (c) 2003 Sergei Kolobov. All rights reserved.

INTRODUCTION
============

FreeBSD Port Tools consist of the following small scripts:
- testport: automate testing a new port or a port update
- pr-new: submit a PR for a new port
- pr-update: submit a PR with a port update to a newer version
- pr-change: submit a PR with a port change (but not update)

FreeBSD Port Tools are available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/porttools/.

NOTE: the Port Tools are currently in alpha state. 
I would appreciate any feedback, comments or suggestions for improvement. 
Patches are welcome.  Contact me at <sergei@kolobov.com>.

BACKGROUND
==========

I have submitted quite a few ports PR myself, and soon got tired of editing
the default send-pr form to fill in the fields. So I first created my own
custom form which simplified the process a little bit, but still not much.

I also wanted to have consistency in the format of Synopsis and other fields.
So I came up with these home-grown tools. I use them for several months now
(approximately since November 2002) and find them quite useful 
(at least, for me).  Hopefully, they could be useful for somebody else.

See list of PRs submitted by me as an example what it looks like:

Each of the scripts now has its own manual pages. Please refer to testport(1),
